I choose Angular because it is based on component structure which implies to easy maintenance and reusability of components. It also have lazy loading feature, which boost performance at the intial loading step of application.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

I use the following 3rd party libraries in my project: 

Name | Reason
--- | ---
[MD Bootstrap Angular](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/angular/) | Because it offers alot of useful features such as theme, charts and table.
[Ngx Pagination](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-pagination) | I have used this pagination because it is easy to use and much simpler than the one which is available in MD Bootstrap Angular library.
